# Rate Limiting Implementation Status

## Completed Components ✅

### 1. Batch Runner (`app/services/batch_runner.py`)
- ✅ Added imports: `time`, `random`, `asynccontextmanager`
- ✅ Initialize OpenAI gating in `__init__`:
  - Semaphore for concurrency control (3 max)
  - Stagger timing (15 seconds)
  - TPM tracking variables
- ✅ Implemented `_is_openai_model()` method
- ✅ Implemented `_await_openai_tpm_budget()` method
- ✅ Implemented `_await_openai_launch_slot()` method  
- ✅ Implemented `_openai_concurrency_context()` context manager
- ✅ Added gating logic in `execute_single_run()`:
  ```python
  if self._is_openai_model(config["model"]):
      await self._await_openai_tpm_budget()
      await self._await_openai_launch_slot()
      async with self._openai_concurrency_context():
          response = await execute_template_run(...)
  ```

### 2. OpenAI Adapter (`app/llm/adapters/openai_adapter.py`)
- ✅ Already has 429 retry logic with exponential backoff
- ✅ Honors Retry-After header
- ✅ Uses jittered backoff
- ✅ Max retry attempts configurable

### 3. API Preflight Guard (`app/api/routes/templates.py`)
- ✅ Checks projected TPM usage before batch execution
- ✅ Returns 503 with `BATCH_RATE_LIMITED` code
- ✅ Now includes `Retry-After` header with time to next minute boundary
- ✅ Returns proper Response object with headers

### 4. Configuration (`app/core/config.py`)
- ✅ All environment variables already configured:
  - `OPENAI_MAX_CONCURRENCY`
  - `OPENAI_STAGGER_SECONDS`
  - `OPENAI_TPM_LIMIT`
  - `OPENAI_TPM_HEADROOM`
  - `OPENAI_EST_TOKENS_PER_RUN`
  - `OPENAI_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS`
  - `OPENAI_BACKOFF_BASE_SECONDS`

### 5. Prometheus Metrics (`app/prometheus_metrics.py`)
- ✅ Metrics already defined and imported
- ✅ Helper functions available

## Testing Results

### Working Components ✅
- **429 Retry Logic**: Successfully handles rate limits with exponential backoff
- **No 429 Errors**: All requests succeed without hitting rate limits in normal operation

### Enforcement Gaps ⚠️
- **Direct API Calls**: Rate limiting only enforced through batch_runner
- **Adapter-Level**: OpenAI adapter itself doesn't enforce concurrency/stagger
- **Test Isolation**: Tests calling adapter directly bypass batch_runner gating

## Architecture Notes

The rate limiting is implemented at the **batch orchestration level** rather than the adapter level:
- Batch runner controls OpenAI request flow
- Adapter handles retries but not preventive limiting
- This is appropriate for batch operations but not for direct API calls

## Recommendations

1. **For Batch Operations**: Current implementation is sufficient
2. **For Direct API Calls**: Would need adapter-level semaphore if needed
3. **Monitoring**: Use Prometheus metrics to track actual usage patterns

## Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in `.env`:
```bash
OPENAI_MAX_CONCURRENCY=3
OPENAI_STAGGER_SECONDS=15
OPENAI_TPM_LIMIT=30000
OPENAI_TPM_HEADROOM=0.15
OPENAI_EST_TOKENS_PER_RUN=7000
OPENAI_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS=5
OPENAI_BACKOFF_BASE_SECONDS=2
```

## Summary

ChatGPT's rate limiting solution has been successfully integrated:
- ✅ All critical methods implemented
- ✅ Retry-After header support added
- ✅ No 429 errors in testing
- ✅ Batch-level orchestration working

The implementation provides multi-layer protection for batch operations while maintaining clean separation of concerns.
