# Looker Studio Dashboard Configuration for `required_pass_reason`

## Overview
This document outlines the Looker Studio configuration to surface the new `required_pass_reason` telemetry dimension alongside existing grounding metrics. This enables monitoring of how REQUIRED grounding mode passes (strict anchored vs. relaxed unlinked_google).

---

## 1. BigQuery Data Source Configuration

### Add Field in BigQuery Connector

In **Looker Studio ‚Üí Data Source (analytics.runs)**:

```text
Field Name: Required Pass Reason
Formula: required_pass_reason
Type: Text (Dimension)
Description: How REQUIRED mode passed: 'anchored' (strict) or 'unlinked_google' (relaxed for Google vendors)
```

### Add Calculated Metrics

```text
Field Name: Anchored Pass Rate
Formula: SUM(CASE WHEN required_pass_reason = "anchored" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(run_id)
Type: Percent
Format: 0.00%

Field Name: Unlinked Google Pass Rate  
Formula: SUM(CASE WHEN required_pass_reason = "unlinked_google" THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(run_id)
Type: Percent
Format: 0.00%

Field Name: Grounding Evidence Rate
Formula: SUM(CASE WHEN required_pass_reason IN ("anchored", "unlinked_google") THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(run_id)
Type: Percent
Format: 0.00%
```

## 2. Overview Dashboard Tab Updates

### Key Metrics Scorecards

Add 3 new scorecards to the top row:

| Metric | Formula | Target | Alert Threshold |

## 4. Alerting Configuration

### Looker Studio Alerts (via Scheduled Email)

#### Alert 1: High Unlinked Google Rate
```sql
-- Trigger Condition
SELECT COUNT(*) > 0
FROM (
  SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN required_pass_reason = 'unlinked_google' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as unlinked_pct
  FROM analytics.runs
  WHERE created_at >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 6 HOUR)
    AND grounding_mode_requested = 'REQUIRED'
) WHERE unlinked_pct > 80
```
**Action**: Email eng-team@company.com
**Frequency**: Every 6 hours

#### Alert 2: Anchored Rate Drop
```sql
-- Trigger if anchored rate drops >20% week-over-week
SELECT COUNT(*) > 0
FROM (
  WITH weekly_rates AS (
    SELECT 
      DATE_TRUNC(created_at, WEEK) as week,
      SUM(CASE WHEN required_pass_reason = 'anchored' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as anchored_rate
    FROM analytics.runs
    WHERE grounding_mode_requested = 'REQUIRED'
    GROUP BY 1
  )
  SELECT 
    curr.anchored_rate - prev.anchored_rate as rate_change
  FROM weekly_rates curr
  JOIN weekly_rates prev ON DATE_ADD(prev.week, INTERVAL 1 WEEK) = curr.week
  WHERE curr.week = DATE_TRUNC(CURRENT_DATE(), WEEK)
) WHERE rate_change < -20
```
**Action**: Slack #eng-alerts channel
**Frequency**: Weekly on Monday

#### Alert 3: Non-Google Unlinked Detection
```sql
-- Should never happen - indicates bug
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM analytics.runs
WHERE required_pass_reason = 'unlinked_google'
  AND vendor NOT IN ('vertex', 'gemini', 'gemini_direct')
  AND created_at >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR)
```
**Action**: PagerDuty high priority
**Frequency**: Every hour

## 5. Executive Dashboard Components

### Summary Card with Narrative

Add a text widget with dynamic values:

```markdown
## Grounding Evidence Quality

In the last 7 days:
- **{anchored_rate}%** of REQUIRED grounding requests had citations directly anchored to answer text (best quality)
- **{unlinked_google_rate}%** used Google's relaxed validation (web search performed, URLs found, but no text anchoring)
- **{none_rate}%** had no grounding evidence (investigate if >10%)

üìä **Trend**: Anchored rate is {trend_direction} {trend_change}% from last week
```

### Definitions Panel

Add a collapsible "‚ÑπÔ∏è Definitions" panel:

```markdown
**Required Pass Reasons Explained:**

‚Ä¢ **anchored** ‚úÖ - Strict validation passed. Citations are tied to specific text spans in the answer.
  Best quality for fact-checking.

‚Ä¢ **unlinked_google** ‚ö†Ô∏è - Relaxed validation for Google vendors (Vertex/Gemini). 
  Web search was performed and URLs discovered, but not anchored to specific text.
  Acceptable for Google due to API limitations.

‚Ä¢ **none** ‚ùå - No grounding evidence found. For REQUIRED mode, this causes request failure.
```

## 6. Advanced: Looker Explore Configuration

### SQL for Derived Table

```sql
-- Create explore-friendly view with pre-computed metrics
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW analytics.runs_explore AS
WITH run_metrics AS (
  SELECT 
    run_id,
    provider,
    model,

    tool_call_count,
    anchored_citations_count,
    unlinked_sources_count,
    latency_ms,
    created_at,
    
    -- Computed flags
    CASE 
      WHEN required_pass_reason = 'anchored' THEN 1 
      ELSE 0 
    END as is_anchored,
    
    CASE

    CASE

SELECT * FROM run_metrics;
```

### Looker Explore YAML

```yaml

## 7. Monitoring & Optimization Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Baseline
- Establish baseline metrics for anchored vs unlinked rates
- Identify models/providers with highest anchored rates
- Document any anomalies

### Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Optimization  
- If anchored rate <40%, investigate extraction logic
- If unlinked_google >60%, check if Google API improved
- A/B test prompt modifications to improve anchored rate

### Phase 3 (Month 2): Policy Tightening
- When anchored rate consistently >60%, consider tightening REQUIRED policy
- Remove relaxation for Google vendors if they start providing anchors
- Add more granular pass reasons (e.g., "partial_anchored")

### Success Metrics
- **Target**: 70% anchored rate within 3 months
- **Acceptable**: 50% anchored + 30% unlinked_google
- **Alert**: <40% combined evidence rate

## Appendix: Sample Queries for Analysis

### Daily Summary Email Query

  COUNT(*) as total_runs,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN required_pass_reason = 'anchored' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as anchored_pct,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN required_pass_reason = 'unlinked_google' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as unlinked_pct,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN required_pass_reason = 'none' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as none_pct
FROM analytics.runs
WHERE created_at >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 24 HOUR)
  AND grounding_mode_requested = 'REQUIRED'
GROUP BY date;
```

### Provider Performance Ranking
```sql
SELECT
  provider,
  COUNT(*) as total_required_runs,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN required_pass_reason = 'anchored' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as anchored_rate,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(CASE WHEN required_pass_reason = 'anchored' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 1.0 / COUNT(*) DESC) as quality_rank
FROM analytics.runs  
WHERE grounding_mode_requested = 'REQUIRED'
  AND created_at >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
GROUP BY provider
ORDER BY quality_rank;
```
