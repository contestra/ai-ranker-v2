Since we are looking into the future, this report is a projection based on current research trajectories and expert forecasts in the longevity and healthspan fields.\n\nHere is a plausible summary of the top longevity and healthspan news for **August 2025**.\n\n***\n\n### **Top Longevity & Healthspan News: August 2025**\n\nThis month has been marked by a landmark clinical trial success and a major regulatory shift, pushing the field of geroscience from the lab closer to the clinic. Here are the top stories:\n\n---\n\n#### **1. Landmark Phase II Trial Shows Partial Reprogramming Reverses Visual Ageing in Humans**\n\n**The Headline:** Aevum Therapeutics has published stunning results from its Phase IIb clinical trial for \"AT-110,\" a therapy using a modified, mRNA-based form of Yamanaka factors. The trial, focused on patients with early-stage glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), demonstrated a statistically significant reversal of epigenetic age in retinal cells and a corresponding functional improvement in vision for 65% of participants.\n\n**Why It Matters:** This is the first major human trial to show that partial epigenetic reprogramming can safely reverse a functional aspect of aging in a specific organ system, not just in mice. The therapy involves a series of targeted injections that transiently express specific factors, \"turning back the clock\" on cellular age without the",
