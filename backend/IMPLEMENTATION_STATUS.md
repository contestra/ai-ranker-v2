# AI Ranker V2 - Implementation Status & Known Issues

## Last Updated: 2025-01-26

## Current State
The system has been updated with stability fixes based on ChatGPT's analysis of test failures. While the core fixes are implemented and unit tested, there are integration issues that need resolution.

## Implemented Features ✅

### 1. Adaptive Token Multiplier for OpenAI
- **Location**: `openai_adapter.py` 
- **Status**: Implemented and unit tested
- Tracks actual vs estimated token ratios for grounded requests
- Uses rolling median of last 10 requests to adjust multiplier
- Clamps multiplier between 1.0 and 2.0
- **Note**: Prevents token underestimation debt spiral

### 2. Window-Edge Jitter for Rate Limiting
- **Location**: `openai_adapter.py`
- **Status**: Implemented and unit tested  
- Adds 500-750ms random jitter when waiting for TPM window reset
- Prevents thundering herd problem at window boundaries

### 3. Tightened Web Search Limits
- **Location**: `openai_adapter.py`
- **Status**: Implemented
- Changed from "2-3 searches" to "at most 2 searches"
- Reduces token explosion from excessive tool calls

### 4. Proxy Circuit Breaker
- **Location**: `proxy_circuit_breaker.py` (NEW), `unified_llm_adapter.py`
- **Status**: Implemented and unit tested
- Opens circuit after 3 proxy failures in 5-minute window
- Auto-downgrades PROXY_ONLY/ALS_PLUS_PROXY → ALS_ONLY
- **Special Policy**: Vertex proxy always disabled (known unstable per adapter warnings)
- 10-minute recovery timeout

### 5. Environment-Based Configuration
- **Files**: `.env.test`, `config.py`
- **Status**: Implemented
- TPM limit now configurable via OPENAI_TPM_LIMIT env var
- Test configuration with reduced limits for stability

## Known Issues & Errors ⚠️

### 1. Proxy Implementation Issues
**Status**: CONTAINS PROXY CODE BUT HAS ERRORS

#### WebShare Proxy Problems:
- **Connection Failures**: 8/32 tests failed with proxy connection errors
- **Error Messages**:
  - OpenAI: "Connection error" 
  - Vertex: "Server disconnected without sending a response"
- **Root Causes**:
  - WebShare proxy authentication may be rate-limited
  - Proxy pool exhaustion for backbone mode
  - TLS/SSL detection by Google (Vertex) blocking proxy connections
  - Timeout cascade with high token requests through proxy

#### Vertex + Proxy Instability:
- **Warning in Code**: `vertex_adapter.py` explicitly warns about GenAI+proxy instability
- **Issue**: HTTP/2 + keep-alive conflicts with residential proxies
- **Mitigation**: Forces HTTP/1.1 with no keep-alive, but still unstable
- **Current Fix**: Circuit breaker always downgrades Vertex proxy requests to ALS_ONLY

### 2. Missing Dependencies for Full Integration
- **Error**: `No module named 'pydantic_settings'`
- **Error**: `No module named 'sqlalchemy'`
- **Impact**: Full integration tests cannot run without proper environment setup
- **Solution**: Need virtual environment with all requirements.txt dependencies

### 3. Rate Limiting Still Hitting 429s in Extreme Cases
- **Scenario**: Tests using 100K+ tokens still occasionally hit limits
- **Issue**: Even with adaptive multiplier, extreme grounded responses can exceed estimates
- **Partial Fix**: Reduced max_tokens to 2000, TPM limit to 24000 (80% of actual)
- **Remaining Risk**: Sequential tests with very high token usage

### 4. Timeout Issues with Grounded+Proxy+6000 Tokens
- **Error**: 5-minute timeout exceeded
- **Scenario**: German locale + grounding + 6000 max_tokens + proxy
- **Partial Fix**: Increased timeout to 240s for grounded, reduced max_tokens to 2000

## Test Results

### Unit Tests (test_fixes_unit.py)
✅ **6/6 Passed**
- All core logic verified without dependencies
- Adaptive multiplier, circuit breaker, jitter all working

### Integration Tests (test_stability_hard.py)
❌ **1/7 Passed** (dependency issues)
- Circuit breaker test passed
- Other tests failed due to missing dependencies

### Expected Improvements (with full environment)
| Issue | Before | After (Expected) |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| OpenAI 429 errors | 3/32 (9.4%) | ~0% |
| Proxy errors | 8/32 (25%) | ~0% (bypassed) |
| Timeouts | 1/32 (3.1%) | ~0% |
| **Total Failures** | **14/32 (43.75%)** | **<5%** |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Fix Proxy Provider**: 
   - Replace WebShare with more reliable service
   - OR implement direct IP allocation
   - OR use residential proxy with better stability

2. **Setup Proper Environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Production Settings**:
   - Keep OPENAI_TPM_LIMIT at 24000 (80% of actual)
   - Keep max_tokens at 2000 for grounded requests
   - Always disable Vertex proxy until stable solution found

### Long-term Improvements:
1. Implement request queuing with proper TPM budgeting
2. Add exponential backoff for all error types
3. Implement proper circuit breaker with half-open state testing
4. Consider removing proxy support for Vertex entirely
5. Add comprehensive telemetry for monitoring actual vs estimated tokens

## Summary
The stability fixes are implemented and unit tested successfully. The core logic is sound and will improve reliability. However, the proxy implementation has significant issues that need addressing, particularly:
- WebShare proxy service is unreliable
- Vertex + proxy combination is fundamentally unstable
- Full integration testing blocked by environment setup issues

**Current Status**: PARTIAL SUCCESS - Core fixes working, proxy features problematic
