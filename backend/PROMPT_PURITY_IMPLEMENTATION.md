# Prompt Purity Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented prompt purity across the Contestra LLM adapters to ensure that:
- No "grounding enforcement" or "search nudges" appear in system messages or user input
- User prompt text remains exactly what the human typed
- System instructions contain only Contestra's canonical system content
- All grounding behavior enforcement happens at the adapter/router level (post-hoc)

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Configuration Settings ✅
Added new configuration options in `app/core/config.py`:
```python
prompt_immutability: str = Field(
    "STRICT",
    description="Prompt immutability mode: STRICT (no modifications) or RELAXED (allow provoker lines)"
)
enable_grounding_nudges: bool = Field(
    False,
    description="Enable grounding instructions in prompts (deprecated, use post-hoc enforcement)"
)
```

### 2. OpenAI Adapter Updates ✅
Modified `app/llm/adapters/openai_adapter.py`:

#### System Message Purity
- Removed automatic concatenation of grounding instructions into `params["instructions"]`
- Grounding nudges now only added when `settings.enable_grounding_nudges = True` (deprecated)
- Default behavior preserves canonical system message unchanged

#### Post-hoc Enforcement
```python
# POST-HOC GROUNDING ENFORCEMENT for REQUIRED mode
if grounding_mode == "REQUIRED" and not grounded_effective:
    error_msg = (
        f"REQUIRED grounding mode specified but no grounding evidence found. "
        f"Tool calls: {tool_call_count}, Web searches: {web_search_count}. "
    )
    raise GroundingRequiredFailedError(error_msg)
```

#### Telemetry Tracking
- Added `grounding_nudges_added` field to metadata
- Tracks grounding attempts without modifying prompts
- Maintains `grounding_attempted`, `grounded_effective`, `why_not_grounded` fields

### 3. Vertex Adapter ✅
The Vertex adapter (`app/llm/adapters/vertex_adapter.py`) already maintains prompt purity:
- ALS blocks handled separately in `_build_content_with_als()`
- System instructions kept separate from user messages
- No grounding nudges added to prompts

### 4. ALS Block Handling ✅
Verified ALS implementation:
- ALS remains as a separate system-adjacent block (≤350 chars)
- Prepended to first user message with clear separation
- Not merged into user content or system instructions
- Structure: `[ALS block]\n\n[Original user message]`

### 5. Test Suite ✅
Created comprehensive test suite in `test_prompt_purity.py`:
- Tests system message purity
- Verifies user prompt immutability
- Confirms ALS block separation
- Validates post-hoc REQUIRED enforcement
- Checks telemetry tracking

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **System message contains no grounding instructions or nudges**
- Grounding instructions removed from default behavior
- Only added when explicitly enabled via `enable_grounding_nudges`

✅ **User prompt is byte-for-byte identical to caller input**
- No modifications to user messages
- Original text preserved exactly

✅ **ALS remains as a separate system block**
- ≤350 chars limit maintained
- Not merged into user content
- Clear separation with `\n\n`

✅ **REQUIRED enforcement happens only after model response inspection**
- Post-hoc check for grounding evidence
- Raises `GroundingRequiredFailedError` when no evidence found
- No prompt modification for enforcement

✅ **Provoker lines only allowed in RELAXED immutability mode**
- Controlled by `prompt_immutability` config
- Default is STRICT (no modifications)

✅ **Unit tests confirm prompt purity**
- `params["input"]` == original user text
- `params["instructions"]` == canonical system message

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Deployments

1. **Default Behavior (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Prompts remain pure by default
   PROMPT_IMMUTABILITY=STRICT
   ENABLE_GROUNDING_NUDGES=false
   ```

2. **Legacy Compatibility Mode**
   ```bash
   # Temporarily enable old behavior during transition
   ENABLE_GROUNDING_NUDGES=true
   ```

3. **Relaxed Mode (Future Use)**
   ```bash
   # Allow provoker lines when needed
   PROMPT_IMMUTABILITY=RELAXED
   ```

### Monitoring

Track these telemetry fields to monitor the migration:
- `grounding_nudges_added`: Whether nudges were added (should be false)
- `grounded_effective`: Whether grounding actually happened
- `required_grounding_failed`: REQUIRED mode failures
- `grounding_status_reason`: Why grounding didn't happen

## Best Practices

1. **Never modify user input** - Preserve exactly what the user typed
2. **Keep system instructions canonical** - No dynamic additions
3. **Enforce grounding post-hoc** - Check response, don't modify prompt
4. **Use telemetry for monitoring** - Track behavior without prompt changes
5. **Fail closed for REQUIRED** - Raise error when evidence missing

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, temporarily enable legacy behavior:
```python
settings.enable_grounding_nudges = True  # Temporary
```

Then investigate and fix root cause before re-disabling.

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All prompt purity requirements have been successfully implemented. The adapters now maintain strict prompt immutability by default, with all grounding enforcement happening post-hoc at the adapter/router level.
