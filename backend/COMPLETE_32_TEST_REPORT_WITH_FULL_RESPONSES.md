Short answer up front: there isn’t a proven “live-longer pill.” The best-supported supplements help maintain the systems that most influence healthy aging (cardio‑metabolic health, muscle function, and cellular resilience). Below are evidence‑based picks you can buy easily in New York City (CVS, Walgreens, Whole Foods, The Vitamin Shoppe) or online, with specific brands chosen for quality/third‑party testing. I’ve noted what the human evidence does—and doesn’t—show.

Core health (highest signal, widely available)
- Omega‑3 EPA/DHA (fish oil): Helps lower risk of several cardiovascular endpoints in meta‑analyses; most benefit is dose‑related. Brands: Nature Made Fish Oil (USP Verified), Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega. Typical dose: 1–2 g/day combined EPA+DHA with food. If you take anticoagulants, speak with your clinician first. ([ahajournals.org](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.119.013543?utm_source=openai), [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32951855/?utm_source=openai), [quality-supplements.org](https://www.quality-supplements.org/usp_verified_products?utm_source=openai))
- Vitamin D3 (if you’re low on a blood test): Supports bone and immune health; benefits are clearest for people who are deficient. Brand: Nature Made Vitamin D3 (USP Verified). Typical dose: personalize to your blood level; many use 1,000–2,000 IU/day. ([quality-supplements.org](https://www.quality-supplements.org/usp_verified_products?utm_source=openai))
- Fiber (psyllium husk): Consistently improves lipids, glycemic control, and regularity. Brands: Metamucil (psyllium) or generic psyllium husk powder. Take with plenty of water.
- Creatine monohydrate: Supports strength and muscle mass as we age, which correlates with better function and fall prevention. Brands: Klean Athlete Creatine (NSF Certified for Sport), Thorne Creatine. Typical dose: 3–5 g/day.

“Longevity‑focused” additions (promising, but not proven to extend lifespan in humans)
- Urolithin A (mitochondrial quality control/mitophagy): In randomized trials, improved muscle endurance and favorably shifted mitochondrial and inflammation biomarkers in middle‑aged and older adults; primary performance endpoints were mixed. Brand: Timeline Mitopure (urolithin A 500–1,000 mg/day). ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35584623/?utm_source=openai), [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8777576/?utm_source=openai))
- Nicotinamide riboside (NR; NAD+ precursor): In human trials, NR raises the NAD+ metabolome in blood and muscle and shows anti‑inflammatory signatures; hard clinical endpoints are still unproven. Brand: Tru Niagen (uses patented Niagen NR). Typical dose: 300–600 mg/day. Note: a related ingredient, NMN, is in U.S. regulatory limbo—the FDA has taken the position that NMN is excluded from the dietary supplement definition pending drug‑development issues—so I recommend NR if you want an NAD+ route. ([cell.com](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247%2819%2930940-4?utm_source=openai), [supplysidesj.com](https://www.supplysidesj.com/supplement-regulations/fda-says-ingredient-studied-as-drug-nmn-is-excluded-from-supplements?utm_source=openai), [wsj.com](https://www.wsj.com/health/wellness/longevity-antiaging-leonard-guarente-business-f55643f4?utm_source=openai))
- GlyNAC (glycine + N‑acetylcysteine): Small randomized trial in older adults reported improvements in multiple aging‑related biomarkers, strength, gait speed, and 6‑minute walk; more/larger studies are needed. Brand options: Nestlé Health Science Celltrient “Cellular Protect” (GlyNAC) or assemble with separate glycine + NAC. Typical trial dose was higher and structured; start low and review with your clinician. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35975308/?utm_source=openai), [bcm.edu](https://www.bcm.edu/news/glynac-improves-strength-and-cognition-in-older-humans?utm_source=openai))

How to choose quality locally
- Look for the USP Verified or NSF/NSF Certified for Sport marks on the bottle; these programs test identity, potency, and contaminants. Brands like Nature Made (including D3 and many fish oils) are listed in USP’s directory and are easy to find at NYC pharmacies and grocery stores. ([quality-supplements.org](https://www.quality-supplements.org/usp_verified_products?utm_source=openai))

Quick safety notes
- Always review supplements with your clinician if you’re on medications (especially blood thinners for fish oil; nitrates for NAC), have kidney/liver issues, are pregnant, or have a cancer history.
- Start one product at a time and track how you feel and any lab changes over 8–12 weeks.
- Prioritize fundamentals first (sleep, resistance training 2–3x/week, cardio, protein 1.0–1.2 g/kg/day, blood pressure, A1c, and lipids). These drive most of the “longevity” benefit; supplements are adjuncts.

Want me to tailor this to you? Tell me your age, any meds/conditions, dietary pattern (e.g., vegan), and budget, and I’ll map these picks to specific NYC stores near 10001 and dial in doses.

Short answer: there’s no pill proven to extend human lifespan. The biggest “longevity levers” are still sleep, exercise (especially resistance training), not smoking, blood pressure/lipid control, and a nutrient-dense diet. Supplements can help if you’re deficient or have specific goals. Below is a concise, evidence-aware shortlist with brands you can readily find in Germany (pharmacies, dm/Rossmann, Reformhaus, Amazon.de, Shop-Apotheke/DocMorris, or direct from the brand).

Foundational picks (good risk–benefit for many adults)
- Vitamin D3 (test and personalize): If your 25(OH)D is low, typical maintenance is 1,000–2,000 IU/day; recheck levels. Brands: Dekristol or Vigantol (pharmacy), Sunday Natural D3+K2, Pure Encapsulations D3. Avoid K2 if you use warfarin unless your doctor approves.
- Omega-3 (EPA/DHA, IFOS- or GOED-certified): About 1–2 g/day combined EPA+DHA with meals. Brands: Norsan Omega-3 Total; Minami MorEPA Platinum; Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega. Vegan options: Norsan Vegan Algenöl; Sunday Natural Algenöl.
- Magnesium (for sleep/muscle, many are low): 200–400 mg elemental/day, preferably bisglycinate/taurate for better tolerance. Brands: Pure Encapsulations Magnesium (bisglycinate); Sunday Natural Magnesium Bisglycinat. Alternative: Magnesium Diasporal (citrate).
- Creatine monohydrate (muscle/strength, possible cognitive benefits): 3–5 g/day. Look for Creapure on the label. Brands: ESN Ultrapure Creatine (Creapure); MyProtein Creatine Monohydrate Creapure.

Often sensible by situation
- Vitamin B12 (vegans, vegetarians, or older adults): 250–500 mcg/day (or 1,000 mcg a few times weekly); check B12/homocysteine. Brands: Hevert B12 (pharmacy), Sunday Natural B12, Pure Encapsulations B12.
- Fiber (for metabolic and gut health): Psyllium 5–10 g/day with plenty of water. Brands: dm Bio Flohsamenschalen; Rossmann enerBiO Flohsamenschalen.
- Protein (to maintain muscle with age): Whey or plant protein as needed to hit daily targets. Brands: ESN Designer Whey; MyProtein Impact Whey; vegan: Vivo Life, MyProtein Vegan Blend.

“Longevity-adjacent” options with mixed but interesting evidence
- CoQ10/ubiquinol (especially if on statins or for heart failure): 100–200 mg/day. Brands: Pharma Nord Bio-Quinone Q10; Pure Encapsulations Ubiquinol-QH; Sunday Natural Ubiquinol (Kaneka).
- Glucosamine sulfate (joints; observational links to lower mortality): 1,500 mg/day. Brands: Dona 1500 (pharmacy); ratiopharm Glucosamin; Doppelherz Glucosamin.
- Taurine (1–3 g/day) and/or glycine (3 g in the evening): supportive data for metabolic health/sleep. Brands: Sunday Natural Taurin/Glycin; MyProtein; Bulk.
- NR (nicotinamide riboside; raises NAD+, outcomes uncertain): Up to 300 mg/day in EU-authorized products. Brands: Tru Niagen; Life Extension NAD+ Cell Regenerator. Note: NMN is not authorized for sale as a supplement in the EU.
- Spermidine (wheat-germ extract; small human studies on cellular aging markers): 1–2 mg/day. Brands: spermidineLIFE; Sunday Natural Spermidin.
- Curcumin (in enhanced-absorption forms) for low-grade inflammation: 500–1,000 mg/day. Brands: Doctor’s Best Curcumin Phytosome (Meriva), Pure Encapsulations Curcumin, Sunday Natural Curcumin C3 + Piperin.
- Berberine (glucose control; many drug interactions): 500 mg 1–2×/day with meals. Brands: Sunday Natural Berberin HCl; Fairvital. Avoid in pregnancy and if on interacting meds unless cleared by a clinician.

How to choose quality
- Look for third-party proofs: IFOS/GOED (fish oil), Creapure (creatine), Kaneka Ubiquinol (CoQ10), K2VITAL (vitamin K2 MK-7), Niagen (NR).
- Buy from reputable pharmacies or brand websites; check lot testing and certificates.

Safety notes
- Talk to your doctor if you take prescription meds, have kidney/liver disease, bleeding risk, are pregnant/breastfeeding, or have upcoming surgery.
- Specific cautions: omega-3 can increase bleeding risk at higher doses; vitamin K2 conflicts with warfarin; magnesium can accumulate in advanced kidney disease; glucosamine may be from shellfish; spermidine from wheat germ contains gluten; berberine interacts with many drugs.
- Best to baseline test: 25(OH)D, omega-3 index, B12 ± homocysteine, ferritin/iron status, and standard cardiometabolic labs; then supplement to target gaps.

If you confirm your city and any dietary pattern or meds, I can narrow this to the best local stores near you and prioritize a minimal, personalized stack.

Short answer up front: no supplement is proven to extend human lifespan. But a few are reasonable if your goal is to support “healthspan” (muscle, metabolic and cardiovascular health) and they’re easy to buy in the U.S. I’d prioritize these, in this order:

1) Creatine monohydrate (3–5 g/day)
- Why: among the best-studied supplements for preserving and improving muscle mass/strength as we age; generally safe for healthy kidneys with adequate hydration.
- Good U.S. brands: Muscle Feast Creapure Creatine Monohydrate (Informed Choice), Klean Athlete Creatine (NSF Certified), Optimum Nutrition Micronized Creatine.
- Notes: choose plain creatine monohydrate powder; you don’t need “HCl” or blends. If you have kidney disease, get clinician approval first. Evidence summary: creatine supports strength and functional outcomes in various adult groups. ([mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/1/95?utm_source=openai))

2) Omega-3s (EPA/DHA) when indicated
- Why: clearest benefits are for people with high triglycerides and for secondary cardiovascular prevention; for general “longevity,” effects are mixed. Prescription-strength omega-3s have the strongest evidence

Happy to help, but “best” depends on your goals, health status, and what’s actually sold where you live. Could you share:
- Your country/city
- Any medical conditions or meds (especially blood thinners, blood pressure meds, diabetes meds, chemo, nitroglycerin)
- Diet (e.g., vegan), fish intake, sun exposure, and any recent labs (vitamin D, B12)
- Budget and form preference (capsule, powder)

In the meantime, here’s an evidence‑first, minimal “longevity” stack most adults can consider, plus reputable brands that are widely available in many regions. Always confirm fit with your clinician and check for interactions.

Strongest evidence if you need them (based on diet/labs)
- Omega‑3 EPA/DHA (if you eat <2 fish meals/week): 1–2 g/day combined EPA+DHA
  Brands: Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega; Carlson Elite EPA/DHA; Minami; Viva Naturals. Vegan: Nordic Naturals Algae Omega, Ovega‑3.
- Vitamin D3 (if low/limited sun): typically 1,000–2,000 IU/day, or dose to reach 25(OH)D ≈30–50 ng/mL
  Brands: Thorne; Nature Made (USP Verified); Carlson; NOW.
- Creatine monohydrate (muscle/aging support): 3–5 g/day
  Brands: Creapure-certified options like Optimum Nutrition Micronized Creatine, Klean Athlete, Thorne.
- Fiber (LDL and glycemic benefits): psyllium 6–10 g/day
  Brands: Metamucil Sugar‑Free; NOW Psyllium Husk.
- B12 (vegans/low levels): 1,000 mcg/day
  Brands: Jarrow; Nature Made.
- Magnesium (if intake is low or cramps/sleep issues): 200–400 mg/day (glycinate/citrate)
  Brands: Doctor’s Best; Pure Encapsulations; NOW.

Promising but not “proven for longevity” (optional)
- Urolithin A (mitochondrial/fitness markers): 500–1,000 mg/day
  Brand: Timeline Nutrition Mitopure.
- CoQ10 100–200 mg + Selenium yeast 100–200 mcg (older adults with low selenium; evidence strongest in Northern Europe)
  Brands: Pharma Nord Bio‑Quinone Q10 + SelenoPrecise (used in KiSel‑10 trial); Life Extension CoQ10; Thorne Selenomethionine. Do not exceed 400 mcg selenium/day.
- GlyNAC (glycine 1.5–3 g + NAC 600–1,200 mg/day): early human data only. Avoid NAC with nitroglycerin; consult if liver/kidney disease.
  Brands: Jarrow NAC Sustain; Thorne Glycine; BulkSupplements Glycine.
- NR/NMN (NAD boosters): raises NAD but no hard clinical outcomes yet; NMN supplement status varies by country.
  Brands: NR—Tru Niagen. NMN—availability depends on jurisdiction.

What to skip or be cautious with
- High‑dose vitamin E or beta‑carotene (possible harm in some groups)
- “Senolytics” (fisetin/quercetin/dasatinib) outside trials
- High‑dose green tea extract (liver risk)
- Resveratrol for longevity (weak human data)

Buying tips
- Look for third‑party testing: USP, NSF, Informed Choice/Sport.
- Avoid proprietary blends without exact doses.
- Start one change at a time and recheck labs where relevant (vitamin D, B12, lipids).

If you share your location, I’ll map these to specific brands and retailers available near you (e.g., Amazon/iHerb/Costco in the US; Holland & Barrett/Pharma Nord in UK/EU; Blackmores in Australia, etc.) and tailor to your meds/diet.

Short answer first: there’s no pill proven to “extend lifespan” in healthy adults. Focus on basics that support healthy aging: omega-3s, creatine, vitamin D if low, fiber, and adequate protein. Here are reliable, widely available U.S. brands.

Omega-3 (EPA/DHA) fish oil
- Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega; Carlson Elite Omega-3; Thorne Super EPA. Prefer products/brands with NSF Certified for Sport to ensure purity. ([nsfsport.com](https://www.nsfsport.com/certified-products/?utm_source=openai))

Creatine monohydrate (for muscle/strength with aging)
- Klean Athlete Klean Creatine; Thorne Creatine; Optimum Nutrition Micronized Creatine Monohydrate (Gold Standard line). Select NSF Certified for Sport-labeled SKUs. ([nsfsport.com](https://www.nsfsport.com/certified-products/?utm_source=openai), [nsfsport-prod.nsf.org](https://nsfsport-prod.nsf.org/certified-products/search-results.php?utm_source=openai))

Vitamin D3 (only if a blood test shows low levels)
- Nature Made Vitamin D3; Thorne D-5,000.

Soluble fiber (for cardiometabolic health and regularity)
- Konsyl Original Psyllium Husk; NOW Psyllium Husk Powder; Metamucil.

Protein (to hit daily protein targets, especially 50+)
- Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey; Momentous Essential Whey; Garden of Life Sport Plant-Based Protein. Look for NSF Certified for Sport where available. ([nsfsport.com](https://www.nsfsport.com/certified-products/?utm_source=openai), [nsfsport-prod.nsf.org](https://nsfsport-prod.nsf.org/certified-products/search-results.php?utm_source=openai))

Quick tips
- Prioritize third-party seals (NSF Certified for Sport or USP Verified) and buy from reputable retailers. ([nsfsport.com](https://www.nsfsport.com/certified-products/?utm_source=openai))
- Check meds and conditions (e.g., anticoagulants, kidney disease) with your clinician before starting supplements.

If you share diet, meds, and preferences (e.g., vegan, pill vs powder), I can tighten this to a short, personalized list.

Short answer: there’s no pill proven to extend human lifespan. But a few well‑studied supplements can support domains of healthy aging (cardiometabolic, musculoskeletal, mitochondrial), and they’re easy to buy in Germany. Below are solid options plus EU‑available brands you can find at dm/Rossmann, in Apotheken, or online (Amazon.de/manufacturer sites).

High‑priority basics (best evidence, good safety)
- Omega‑3 (EPA/DHA) 1,000–2,000 mg/day EPA+DHA
  Brands: NORSAN Omega‑3 Total (liquid, pharmacies/online), Minami MorEPA Platinum (capsules). Vegan: NORSAN Omega‑3 Vegan (algae oil).
- Vitamin D3 (ideally after a blood test; target 25(OH)D ~30–50 ng/mL). Often pair with K2.
  Brands: Sunday Natural Vitamin D3 + K2 drops; Natural Elements D3 + K2. Note: K2 can interfere with warfarin.
- Creatine monohydrate 3–5 g/day (strength, muscle, cognition support)
  Look for Creapure (German-made, high purity). Brands: ESN Ultrapure Creatine (Creapure), MyProtein Creatine Monohydrate Creapure, Bulk Creatine Monohydrate Creapure.
- Magnesium 200–400 mg elemental/day (glycinate or citrate)
  Brands: Sunday Natural Magnesium Bisglycinat; Pure Encapsulations Magnesium Glycinate.
- Fiber (psyllium husk) 5–10 g/day with water (lipids, glycemic control, gut health)
  Brands: dmBio Flohsamenschalen; Sunday Natural Organic Psyllium Husk.

Optional add‑ons (context‑dependent, evidence varies)
- CoQ10 (prefer ubiquinol) 100–200 mg/day, especially if 50+ or on statins
  Brands: Sunday Natural Ubiquinol (Kaneka); Pure Encapsulations Ubiquinol‑QH 100 mg. Note: can reduce warfarin effect (INR).
- Nicotinamide riboside (NR) 300 mg/day (NAD+ precursor; human data on function > lifespan)
  Brands: Tru Niagen (Niagen); Life Extension NAD+ Cell Regenerator (Niagen). Note: NMN is not approved as a supplement in the EU.
- Trans‑resveratrol 150–300 mg/day with food (cardiometabolic/antioxidant; mixed human data)
  Brands: Life Extension Optimized Resveratrol; Sunday Natural Trans‑Resveratrol (≥98% trans). Note: may potentiate anticoagulants/antiplatelets.
- Spermidine 1–2 mg/day from wheat‑germ extract (promising but early human data)
  Brands: spermidineLIFE Original 365+; Sunday Natural Spermidin. Check gluten status if sensitive.
- Taurine 1–3 g/day (early but interesting data; not proven for lifespan)
  Brands: Bulk Taurine Powder; ESN Taurine.
- Curcumin with enhanced bioavailability (Longvida/Meriva or with piperine) 500–1,000 mg/day
  Brands: Pure Encapsulations Curcumin 500 with BioPerine; NOW Curcumin Phytosome (Meriva). Note: bleeding risk with anticoagulants; avoid with gallbladder issues.
- Vitamin K2 MK‑7 100–200 µg/day if you don’t take a D3+K2 combo
  Brands: Sunday Natural Vitamin K2 MK‑7 all‑trans (K2VITAL); Natural Elements K2 MK‑7. Avoid with warfarin unless supervised.

Buying tips in Germany
- Pharmacies often stock NORSAN and Pure Encapsulations; dm/Rossmann carry basics like psyllium and D3. Sunday Natural, ESN, Minami, Life Extension, Tru Niagen are available via their EU sites or Amazon.de.
- Quality markers: Creapure (creatine), Kaneka Ubiquinol (CoQ10), Niagen (NR), K2VITAL or MenaQ7 (K2), “trans‑resveratrol ≥98%”.

Safety and fit
- Talk to your Arzt/Apotheke if you take prescription meds (especially anticoagulants, antiplatelets, diabetes or blood‑pressure drugs), are pregnant, or have chronic conditions.
- Prioritize testing vitamin D, and consider Omega‑3 index; tailor B12/iron to your diet.

If you tell me your diet (omnivore/vegan), medications, and main goals (e.g., cardiovascular, cognition, bones, sleep), I can trim this to a simple 3–5 item stack and exact doses for you.

Short answer first: there isn’t a single “longevity pill.” For most healthy adults in the U.S., the best-supported approach is to cover basics that protect long‑term health (diet, exercise, sleep, no tobacco, moderate alcohol) and only add targeted supplements when there’s a clear need or deficiency. Large, independent reviews find that routine vitamin/mineral supplementation does not prevent cardiovascular disease or cancer in generally
