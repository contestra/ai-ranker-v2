In the U.S., including New York, there is **no value‚Äëadded tax (VAT)**.  

Instead, New York applies a **state sales tax** of **4%**, and New York City adds a **local sales tax** of **4.5%**, plus a **0.375% Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District (MCTD) surcharge**.  

That makes the **combined standard sales tax rate in New York City = 8.875%**.  

So if you‚Äôre asking for the VAT equivalent in New York: there is none ‚Äî the relevant figure is the **8.875% sales tax rate**.  

Would you like me to break down how that would apply to your $12.90 DMV service fee, or note whether certain government fees (like DMV charges) are even subject to sales tax?

**Step 1: Clarify the request**  
You asked: *‚ÄúWhat is the VAT rate? As of today (2025‚Äë08‚Äë30), include an official source URL.‚Äù*  
- In the U.S. (including New York), there is **no VAT (Value Added Tax)** system. The U.S. uses **sales tax** at the state and local level instead.  
- Since your context is New York, the equivalent tax is *New York State Sales and Use Tax*.  

---

**Step 2: Confirm the current New York State sales tax**  
According to New York State Department of Taxation and Finance:  
- **Statewide base sales tax rate: 4%**  
- New York City imposes an additional **4.5% local sales tax**  
- There is also a **0.375% Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District (MCTD) sales tax** for the NYC metro region.  

‚û°Ô∏è **Total in New York City = 8.875%**

The U.S. does not use a Value Added Tax (VAT). Instead, states apply sales tax.  

For **New York**, the **state sales tax rate is 4%**, and in New York City there is an additional **4.5% city sales tax**, plus a **0.375% Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District (MCTD) surcharge**.  

That makes the combined general sales tax rate in NYC **8.875%**.  

So, while there is no VAT in New York, the comparable rate you actually pay on taxable purchases in NYC is **8.875% sales tax**.  

Would you like me to also show how that rate would apply to the $12.90 DMV charge if it were subject to sales tax?

In Germany, the **standard VAT (Mehrwertsteuer, MwSt.) rate is 19‚ÄØ%**.  

There is also a **reduced rate of 7‚ÄØ%** for certain goods and services (e.g. food, books, public transport), but for administrative fees such as a passport application or appointments, no VAT is charged at all ‚Äî these are official fees, not commercial services.  

üëâ So:
- **General VAT rate:** 19‚ÄØ%  
- **Reduced VAT rate:** 7‚ÄØ%  
- **Passport/administrative fees (e.g. 12,90‚ÄØ‚Ç¨ in your example):** not subject to VAT  

Would you like me to break down exactly why public authority fees (e.g. "Reisepass beantragen") are not taxed with VAT?

While the United States does not have a national Value-Added Tax (VAT), New York City has a combined sales and use tax rate of 8.875%.

This rate is a combination of three separate taxes:
*   **New York State sales and use tax:** 4.0%
*   **New York City local sales and use tax:** 4.5%
*   **Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District (MCTD) surcharge:** 0.375%

This combined rate applies to the retail sale and use of most tangible personal property and certain services within New York City. However, there are some exemptions, such as for most non-prepared food items, prescription drugs, and clothing and footwear costing less than $110. For clothing and footwear purchases of $110 or more, the full 8.875% tax rate applies.

Based on the context provided, the VAT rate is **19%**.

The abbreviation "MwSt." stands for *Mehrwertsteuer* (German for VAT), and the mention of "allgemeine Ausk√ºnfte" (general information) indicates the standard VAT rate in Germany applies.

In Germany, the standard value-added tax (VAT) rate is 19%. This rate applies to most goods and services. A reduced VAT rate of 7% is applicable only to specific goods and services, such as basic foodstuffs and books.

For "allgemeine Ausk√ºnfte," which translates to general information services, the standard VAT rate of 19% is applied. This is because, as a general principle, all services are subject to the standard tax rate unless they are explicitly listed as exceptions that qualify for the reduced rate.

Consulting and information services that are not directly aimed at the sale of a specific product are generally subject to the 19% VAT rate. Furthermore, electronic services provided to a recipient within Germany are also taxed at the standard rate of 19%.
