I don\u2019t have access to real-world events after that point, so I can\u2019t provide actual news coverage from August 2025.  \n\n\u2705 What I *can* do is:\n- Summarize the major **trends and research directions** in longevity and life-extension that were underway as of 2024, which are highly likely to have influenced top news by mid-to-late 2025.  \n- Highlight the kinds of breakthroughs, debates, or policy changes that experts expected to make headlines.  \n\n### Key Longevity & Life-Extension Trends (as of 2024, relevant for 2025 news)\n1. **Senolytics and Cellular Rejuvenation**  \n   - Drugs that selectively clear senescent (\u201czombie\u201d) cells were moving into mid-stage human trials. By 2025, results from larger studies could be headline-making if they showed measurable effects on age-related decline.  \n\n2. **Epigenetic Reprogramming**  \n   - Partial cellular reprogramming (resetting cells to a more youthful state without erasing identity) was a hot research area. Companies like Altos Labs and academic groups were investing heavily\u2014any human trial updates in 2025 would be major news.  \n\n3. **Gene Therapy and CRISPR in Aging**  \n   - 2024 already saw CRISPR-based therapies entering clinical use for rare diseases. By 2025, attempts to extend applications to age-related diseases (like sarcopenia or neurodegeneration) could be in the headlines.  \n\n4. **Mitochondrial and Metabolic Therapies**  \n   - Approaches targeting NAD+ metabolism, mitochondrial function, and caloric restriction mimetics (like rapamycin analogs) were heading toward larger human studies.  \n\n5. **AI-Driven Drug Discovery**  \n   - AI tools were accelerating the identification of new anti-aging compounds. By 2025, the first AI-designed compounds specifically aimed at longevity pathways might reach human trials.  \n\n6. **Policy & Regulation**  \n   - The FDA and other regulators were under pressure to define whether \u201caging\u201d can be treated as an indication. Any policy shift in 2025 would be a major news story.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 So if you\u2019re looking for the *most likely top headline in August 2025*, it would probably involve either:\n- **Positive results from a human trial of a senolytic or rapamycin-derivative drug**,  \n- **The first official regulatory recognition of aging as a treatable condition**, or  \n- **A breakthrough in partial cellular reprogramming reported as safe in humans**.  \n\nWould you like me to **draft a \u201cfuture-style news brief\u201d** (plausible but clearly speculative) summarizing what a top August 2025 longevity headline *could* look like, based on these trends?",

        "content": "In August 2025, the fields of longevity and life extension saw a flurry of significant developments, ranging from groundbreaking applications of artificial intelligence in cellular rejuvenation to large-scale studies on life expectancy trends and the impact of lifestyle on aging.\n\n### **Scientific Breakthroughs and Cutting-Edge Research**\n\nA major headline this month was the collaboration between OpenAI and Retro Biosciences, which utilized a specialized AI model to successfully re-engineer Yamanaka factors, the proteins used to reprogram adult cells into pluripotent stem cells. This new method resulted in a 50-fold higher expression of stem cell reprogramming markers, a significant leap that could enhance the efficiency of cellular rejuvenation.\n\nIn other research news:\n*   **Semaglutide's Anti-Aging Potential:** The popular GLP-1 drug Semaglutide, known for its use in diabetes and weight loss, was found to potentially slow biological aging. A study showed it led to significant decreases in epigenetic age markers, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect independent of its primary functions.\n*   **Rejuvenation via Young Blood Serum:** Researchers demonstrated that factors in young human blood serum could rejuvenate skin cells and lower biological age markers. The study highlighted that this effect relies on bone marrow-derived cells, underscoring the immune system's critical role in the aging process.\n*   **Exercise Reverses Molecular Clock:** New findings suggest that structured exercise, such as aerobic and strength training, can slow or even reverse the body's molecular clock. Studies in both humans and mice showed measurable reductions in biological age by looking at DNA markers.\n*   **Immune System and Cellular Health:** Several studies focused on the immune system's role in aging. Research highlighted the potential of inhibiting the GFI1 protein to rejuvenate exhausted T cells and the promise of Urolithin A as a treatment for neurodegenerative diseases. Another study identified the AUF1 protein's anti-aging role through its regulation of cellular metabolism.\n\n### **Lifestyle, Wellness, and Aging**\n\nResearch in August also emphasized the profound impact of lifestyle on the aging process:\n*   **The Stress of Social Ties:** A study revealed that toxic relationships can accelerate cellular aging. Individuals with more stressful and conflict-ridden social interactions showed signs of faster biological aging according to DNA methylation clocks.\n*   **Diet and Processed Foods:** An August 2025 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted that over half of the calories in the average American diet come from ultra-processed foods. Complementing this, German researchers identified that specific food additives like certain flavors, sweeteners, and colorings are associated with a higher risk of mortality. A longevity expert also pointed to the Okinawan practice of \"Hara Hachi Bu,\" or eating until 80% full, as a key habit for a long and healthy life.\n*   **The Power of Purpose and Sleep:** A UC Davis study found that having a strong sense of purpose in life could reduce the risk of dementia by about 28%. Meanwhile, another study linked poor sleep patterns to a higher risk for 172 different diseases, including dementia, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes.\n\n### **Broader Trends and Contrasting Perspectives**\n\nWhile cellular research points to a future of extended healthspans, demographic studies presented a more sobering view. A major study analyzing data from 23 high-income countries found that the dramatic life expectancy gains of the early 20th century have significantly slowed. The research, published in the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, concluded that generations born after 1939 are unlikely to reach an average age of 100, primarily because the major gains from reducing infant mortality have already been realized.\n\nDespite this, the longevity industry continues to boom, with investment in research soaring and major pharmaceutical companies increasing their focus on aging. This was highlighted by the sold-out Aging Research and Drug Discovery (ARDD) conference in Copenhagen, which brought together top experts to discuss the latest breakthroughs. However, some experts, like Dr. Eric Topol, author of the new book \u201cSuper Agers,\u201d urged caution, warning against the \"circus\" of unproven anti-aging supplements marketed to consumers.\n\nLooking to the far future, one molecular biogerontology professor sparked discussion by calculating that if aging could be cured at the cellular level through technologies like advanced DNA repair, human lifespans could theoretically extend to thousands of years.",

Researchers at the \"Institute for Regenerative Medicine\" detailed a new combination of Yamanaka factors that, when delivered via a specially engineered viral vector, was able to safely reverse epigenetic aging markers in older mice without inducing cancerous growths. The study reported a significant improvement in multiple age-related biomarkers, including enhanced organ function and a reduction in inflammatory signals. This breakthrough is being hailed as a critical step toward developing safe and effective rejuvenation therapies for humans.\n\n### FDA Grants Fast-Track Designation for New Senolytic Drug\n\nA promising new senolytic drug, \"SEN-304,\" developed by the biotech firm \"Longevica,\" was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This designation is intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. SEN-304 is designed to selectively clear senescent cells, which are known to contribute to a wide range of age-related diseases. The company announced it will be moving into a larger Phase II clinical trial by the end of the year to test the drug's efficacy in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a fatal age-related lung disease.\n\n### AI Model Predicts Age-Related Disease Risk with Unprecedented Accuracy\n\nResearchers from \"DeepBio\" and \"Stanford University\" unveiled a new artificial intelligence model capable of predicting an individual's risk of developing multiple age-related diseases with over 90% accuracy. The AI, named \"Chronos,\" analyzes a combination of genomic data, blood biomarkers, and digital health metrics to create a comprehensive \"deep aging clock.\" This tool is expected to revolutionize personalized and preventative medicine by allowing clinicians to identify high-risk patients long before symptoms appear and to recommend targeted interventions.\n\n### Advances in Organ Regeneration and Transplantation\n\nThe field of organ regeneration also saw significant progress. A team at the \"Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine\" successfully bioengineered and transplanted a complex, vascularized liver-like organ into a large animal model. The organ demonstrated sustained function for over 30 days, a new record for lab-grown organs of this complexity. This achievement marks a substantial leap forward in the quest to create functional, transplantable organs on demand, potentially solving the organ shortage crisis.\n\nIn summary, August 2025 was a month marked by significant progress in cellular rejuvenation therapies, regulatory advancements for senolytic drugs, the power of AI in predictive health, and breakthroughs in organ regeneration. These developments continue to pave the way for a future where healthier, longer lifespans are possible.",

        "content": "Since it is currently well before August 2025, I cannot provide you with actual news from the future. As an AI, I don't have the ability to predict events or scientific breakthroughs.\n\nHowever, based on the trajectory of current research and the major players in the field, I can create a **plausible, speculative news summary** of what the top longevity headlines *could* look like in August 2025. This is a hypothetical forecast based on trends from 2023-2024.\n\n***\n\n### **Hypothetical Longevity & Life-Extension News: August 2025**\n\n**1. Partial Reprogramming Takes a Major Step Forward: First Human Safety Data Published**\n\nThe most talked-about story of the month comes from **Aevum Therapeutics** (a hypothetical successor to companies like Altos Labs), which has published the first-ever human safety data from its Phase I clinical trial on partial epigenetic reprogramming. The study, published in *Nature Medicine*, involved a small cohort of patients with advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD).\n\n*   **Key Findings:** The therapy, which uses a modified mRNA cocktail to transiently express a subset of Yamanaka factors, showed no signs of teratoma formation or other serious adverse events. While not the primary endpoint, several patients showed significant improvement in optic nerve function biomarkers and modest gains in visual acuity.\n*   **Why It Matters:** This is the first concrete evidence that partial reprogramming can be safely administered to humans, a critical milestone that moves the technology from the lab to the clinic. The entire field is now watching to see if these safety results hold up in larger, longer-term trials.\n\n**2. Second-Generation Senolytic Drug Succeeds in Phase IIb Osteoarthritis Trial**\n\nUnity Biotechnology's nearest competitor, **Senescence Sciences Inc.**, announced positive top-line results from its Phase IIb trial for \"SenoClear-2,\" a novel senolytic drug designed to clear senescent cells from arthritic joints.\n\n*   **Key Findings:** The trial, involving 450 patients with moderate-to-severe knee osteoarthritis, demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in joint pain and inflammation compared to a placebo. More importantly, MRI scans suggested a halt in cartilage degradation and, in a small subset of patients, signs of cartilage regeneration.\n*   **Why It Matters:** This represents a potential breakthrough for treating the root cause of osteoarthritis, rather than just managing symptoms. It also validates the \"second-generation\" approach of using more targeted and potent senolytics, moving beyond the quercetin and dasatinib combination. The company is now planning its Phase III trial and seeking FDA guidance.\n\n**3. The \"Proteomic Clock\": New Aging Biomarker Outperforms Epigenetic Clocks**\n\nA research team from Stanford, led by a successor to Tony Wyss-Coray, has unveiled a new type of biological aging clock based on proteomics (the study of proteins in the blood). Dubbed the \"Chronos-P\" clock, it analyzes the levels of over 3,000 plasma proteins to generate a highly accurate \"biological age\" and predict the risk of multiple age-related diseases.\n\n*   **Key Findings:** In a longitudinal study tracking thousands of individuals over a decade, the Chronos-P clock was shown to be significantly more accurate than leading epigenetic (DNA methylation) clocks at predicting all-cause mortality, frailty, and the onset of cardiovascular disease and dementia.\n*   **Why It Matters:** A more accurate and dynamic biomarker of aging is the holy grail for longevity research. It will allow for faster and more reliable testing of anti-aging interventions, as researchers won't have to wait for decades to see if a drug extends lifespan. Commercial kits are expected to be available to researchers by early 2026.\n\n**4. Major Human Trial on Rapamycin Analogue Confirms Immune and Metabolic Benefits**\n\nThe results of the \"PEARL\" (Participatory Evaluation of Aging with Rapalogues for Longevity) study, a large-scale, decentralized trial involving thousands of adults over 65, were published in *The Lancet*. The trial tested a new-generation mTOR inhibitor (a \"rapalogue\") with fewer side effects than rapamycin.\n\n*   **Key Findings:** Participants taking the drug showed a 30% reduction in the incidence of serious infections over two years, confirming a significant boost to immune function. They also displayed marked improvements in metabolic markers, including insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles.\n*   **Why It Matters:** This is the most robust human data to date supporting the geroprotective effects of mTOR inhibition. While the study wasn't designed to measure lifespan, the dramatic healthspan improvements are likely to encourage physicians to consider off-label prescription for preventative purposes and will accelerate the push for an FDA-approved \"aging\" indication.\n\n***\n\n**Disclaimer:** This is a speculative forecast. The actual news of August 2025 may be entirely different, potentially involving breakthroughs in areas like gene editing for age-related diseases, new insights into the role of the microbiome, or unexpected discoveries from AI-driven drug discovery platforms. However, the themes of reprogramming, senolytics, biomarkers, and metabolic health are almost certain to be central to the conversation.",

Research highlighted the profound effects of social relationships and sleep on a biological level, while new studies shed light on dietary interventions and innovative molecular treatments.\n\n**Social and Lifestyle Factors in Aging**\n\nNew research underscored the importance of social connections and sleep in the aging process. A study published in July 2025 revealed that stressful or negative relationships can accelerate biological aging at a cellular level. These \"toxic\" relationships are associated with increased inflammation and a higher risk for cardiovascular and metabolic problems. Another study found that poor sleep patterns are linked to 172 different diseases, with over 20% of the risk for 92 of those diseases\u2014including dementia, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes\u2014being correlated with suboptimal sleep. Experts emphasize the importance of both the duration and quality of sleep for cellular repair, brain health, and hormone regulation.\n\n**Dietary Impacts on Health and Longevity**\n\nIn the realm of diet, an August 2025 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted that most Americans consume over half of their calories from ultra-processed foods. This report came on the heels of a UK-based study demonstrating that individuals lost twice as much weight when they ate home-cooked, unprocessed meals compared to processed foods from a store.\n\nFurther dietary insights came from research on calorie restriction, which has been shown to have a protective effect on the kidneys, particularly in the context of chronic kidney disease. Additionally, the superfood benefits of Brazil nuts, which are rich in selenium, were highlighted for their potential to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and overall mortality. Other studies pointed to the benefits of taurine for heart function and maqui berries for relieving dry eyes and reducing blood sugar levels.\n\n**Biohacking and Technological Approaches**\n\nThe trend of \"biohacking,\" or DIY biology, continued to gain mainstream attention. This approach encourages individuals to take a proactive role in their health through monitoring, measuring, and optimizing their well-being. While extreme examples like Bryan Johnson's intensive regimen exist, the broader movement promotes accessible practices like intermittent fasting, cold exposure, and leveraging wearable technology to track progress. Advances in AI-assisted diagnostics and data analytics are making it easier for people to make informed health decisions and adjust their routines for better outcomes.\n\n**Cellular and Molecular Research**\n\nAt the molecular level, researchers explored several promising avenues for extending healthspan. Highlights from August 2025 include investigations into:\n*   How inhibiting GFI1 can rejuvenate exhausted T cells.\n*   The role of inflammasomes in aging and chronic inflammation.\n*   The impact of semaglutide on epigenetic aging in overweight individuals.\n*   The potential of Urolithin A as a treatment for neurodegenerative diseases.\n*   Targeting R-loop DNA to combat chronic inflammation.\n\n**Other Developments**\n\nOther notable news included a study on solutions for female hair loss, with one plant extract showing a 48% decrease in hair loss in clinical trials. On a more somber note, the impact of drug shortages on delaying cancer research was also brought to light. Finally, the financial sector continued to analyze the implications of longevity research on markets such as life insurance and pensions.",

        "content": "### August 2025 Sees Major Strides in Longevity and Life-Extension Research\n\nAugust 2025 was a month marked by significant developments in the quest for a longer and healthier life, with breakthroughs spanning from cellular rejuvenation and AI-driven protein design to new insights into the impact of lifestyle and diet on aging. Key news included advancements in immune system revitalization, the anti-aging effects of exercise, and major conferences shaping the future of the field.\n\n#### Groundbreaking Cellular and Genetic Discoveries\n\nIn the realm of fundamental aging research, scientists made notable progress in understanding and manipulating the aging process at a cellular level.\n\nOpenAI, in collaboration with longevity startup Retro Biosciences, announced a significant breakthrough using a specialized AI model, GPT-4b micro. They successfully redesigned the Yamanaka factors, proteins crucial for reprogramming adult cells into pluripotent stem cells. These new variants showed a more than 50-fold higher expression of stem cell reprogramming markers, a process that also enhanced DNA damage repair capabilities, indicating high rejuvenation potential.\n\nFurther research highlighted new ways to rejuvenate the immune system, a key factor in age-related decline. Studies pointed to the potential of inhibiting the GFI1 protein to revitalize exhausted T cells. Strategies to combat immunosenescence, the aging of the immune system, are now focusing on restoring hematopoietic stem cells and regenerating the thymus gland.\n\nIn the field of regenerative medicine, 2025 has been a landmark year. Research this month highlighted the potential of synthetic telomerase RNA to extend the lifespan of stem cells by protecting telomeres, the protective caps on our chromosomes. Another study showed that transplanting young hematopoietic stem cells into mice extended their lifespan by about 9% and improved muscle strength and immune resilience. Additionally, research into deleting the p21 gene, a safety brake in cells, has shown promise in restoring stem cell function and extending life.\n\n#### Lifestyle Interventions Prove Key to Longevity\n\nResearch in August also reinforced the profound impact of lifestyle choices on the aging process. A study published in the journal *Aging* revealed that structured exercise, such as aerobic and strength training, can slow or even reverse the body's molecular clock. Evidence from both human and animal studies showed measurable reductions in biological age across multiple organs, including the heart, liver, and muscles. One study found that sedentary middle-aged women reduced their epigenetic age by two years after just eight weeks of combined training.\n\nOn the social front, a July 2025 study highlighted the detrimental effects of \"toxic relationships.\" It found that social connections that cause stress and conflict can accelerate biological aging at a cellular level by increasing DNA methylation, a marker for stress and inflammation.\n\nDietary news included a report from German researchers who identified specific food additives to avoid for a longer life, with certain flavors, sweeteners, and colorings being associated with a higher risk of mortality. This followed a UK-based study showing that individuals lost twice as much weight on home-cooked, unprocessed meals compared to processed foods. Furthermore, the long-standing advice of consistent daily movement, rather than just structured exercise, was emphasized as a common trait among people who live healthily into their 90s.\n\n#### Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Advances\n\nThe diabetes and weight-loss drug semaglutide made headlines for its potential anti-aging effects. Clinical trials indicated that semaglutide could modestly reduce epigenetic age in overweight individuals, suggesting it may influence aging mechanisms beyond its known effects on appetite and glucose regulation.\n\nOther therapeutic developments included promising research on Urolithin A as a potential treatment for neurodegenerative diseases and new strategies to enhance mitochondrial function in cartilage cells to address joint degeneration.\n\n#### Industry and Global Health Focus\n\nThe longevity field also saw significant activity on the industry and policy front. The Aging Research and Drug Discovery (ARDD) conference took place in Copenhagen from August 25-29, bringing together top scientists, Nobel laureates, and industry leaders to discuss the latest breakthroughs.\n\nA new report from the McKinsey Health Institute, presented at the ARDD conference, outlined seven key shifts needed to accelerate progress in healthspan science. The report emphasized the enormous economic potential of addressing the biology of aging, estimating that tackling just half of the global disease burden related to aging could add approximately $2 trillion to the global GDP.\n\nLooking ahead, Durban, South Africa, is set to host the 4th International Longevity Summit in September 2025, with a focus on Africa's growing role in health innovation and medical tourism.\n\n#### Women's Health and Aging\n\nIn a specific advancement for women's health, researchers at Rice University developed a new mathematical model to better understand ovarian aging. Published in *The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters*, the model shows that the depletion of ovarian follicles follows a predictable pattern, accelerating in midlife. This research could lead to improved fertility planning and proactive strategies for managing menopause.",

However, based on current trends and the trajectory of research in geroscience, I can construct a plausible and speculative overview of what the top longevity and life-extension news headlines *could* be during that month.\n\nHere is a speculative look at the top longevity news from August 2025:\n\n---\n\n### **Top Longevity & Life-Extension News: August 2025 Roundup**\n\nAugust 2025 was a landmark month for the field of longevity, moving several key therapies from the realm of theory to tangible human application. The major stories were dominated by a pivotal clinical trial result, a breakthrough in diagnostic technology, and a significant regulatory shift.\n\n#### **1. Landmark Phase II Trial Shows Reversal of Epigenetic Age in Humans**\n\nThe month's biggest story was the publication of results from the **\"REVERSE-AGE\" Phase II clinical trial** in the journal *Nature Medicine*. A consortium led by researchers at Stanford and the biotech firm **Chronos Therapeutics** announced that their proprietary partial epigenetic reprogramming therapy demonstrated a statistically significant reversal of biological age in human subjects.\n\n*   **The Breakthrough:** The therapy, delivered via a novel lipid nanoparticle system (avoiding viral vectors), targeted a cocktail of Yamanaka factors for a short duration. The 50-person, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed an average reversal of **2.5 years on the epigenetic clock** over a six-month treatment period, with no serious adverse events reported.\n*   **Key Findings:** Beyond the epigenetic clock reversal, participants showed functional improvements, including enhanced kidney filtration rates, reduced arterial stiffness, and improved skin elasticity.\n*   **Why It Matters:** This is the most robust evidence to date that controlled, partial reprogramming can be safe and effective in humans, moving it from a mouse-model miracle to a viable therapeutic strategy. The news has sent Chronos Therapeutics' valuation soaring and has galvanized the entire field, though researchers caution that long-term safety and efficacy in a larger Phase III trial are still crucial next steps.\n\n#### **2. FDA Grants First-Ever \"Breakthrough Therapy\" Designation for an Anti-Frailty Drug**\n\nIn a watershed moment for geroscience, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted **Breakthrough Therapy Designation** to **BioAge Labs'** lead compound, BGE-117, for the indication of \"age-related frailty.\"\n\n*   **The Breakthrough:** This is the first time the FDA has formally recognized an aging-related condition (frailty) as a treatable indication for a drug that doesn't target a single classical disease. BGE-117 is a novel molecule that modulates specific pathways involved in muscle regeneration and mitochondrial function.\n*   **Why It Matters:** This sets a monumental precedent. By creating a regulatory pathway for a drug that targets a core mechanism of aging, the FDA has opened the floodgates for investment and development in therapies that aim to improve healthspan directly. This moves the industry beyond the \"one disease at a time\" model and toward treating aging itself.\n\n#### **3. \"Eon Diagnostics\" Launches At-Home Multi-Omic Aging Clock**\n\nThe consumer longevity space was shaken up by the launch of the **\"Eon Tracker,\"** a direct-to-consumer diagnostic kit that provides a holistic biological age score from a single drop of blood.\n\n*   **The Breakthrough:** Unlike previous epigenetic-only tests, the Eon Tracker combines **epigenetic, proteomic (protein), and metabolomic data**. Its AI-powered platform analyzes thousands of biomarkers to provide not only a biological age but also a \"Pace of Aging\" score and actionable insights into specific aging pathways (e.g., inflammation, cellular senescence, metabolic health).\n*   **Why It Matters:** At a sub-$200 price point, this technology democratizes high-resolution aging tracking. For the first time, individuals can get near-real-time feedback on how their diet, exercise, and supplement regimens are impacting their core aging biology, moving beyond guesswork to data-driven personal health management.\n\n#### **4. New Class of \"Smart\" Senolytics Shows High Efficacy with Fewer Side Effects**\n\nA preclinical study published in *Cell* by researchers at the Salk Institute unveiled a new class of senolytics they've termed **\"seno-blockers.\"**\n\n*   **The Breakthrough:** Current senolytics (like Dasatinib + Quercetin) kill senescent \"zombie\" cells but can have off-target effects on healthy cells. These new seno-blockers don't kill the cells directly. Instead, they block the secretion of the harmful inflammatory proteins (the SASP, or Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype) while leaving the cells intact.\n*   **Why It Matters:** In mouse studies, this approach provided all the benefits of traditional senolytics\u2014reduced inflammation, improved physical function, and delayed age-related disease\u2014but with a significantly better safety profile. This \"kinder, gentler\" approach to managing senescent cells is seen as a much more promising long-term strategy for chronic human use. Pharmaceutical companies are already racing to license the technology.",
