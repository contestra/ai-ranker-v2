Below are evidence\u2011based picks you can buy easily in New York City (CVS, Walgreens, Whole Foods, The Vitamin Shoppe) or online, with specific brands chosen for quality/third\u2011party testing. I\u2019ve noted what the human evidence does\u2014and doesn\u2019t\u2014show.\n\nCore health (highest signal, widely available)\n- Omega\u20113 EPA/DHA (fish oil): Helps lower risk of several cardiovascular endpoints in meta\u2011analyses; most benefit is dose\u2011related. Brands: Nature Made Fish Oil (USP Verified), Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega. Typical dose: 1\u20132 g/day combined EPA+DHA with food. If you take anticoagulants, speak with your clinician first. ([ahajournals.org](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.119.013543?utm_source=openai), [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32951855/?utm_source=openai), [quality-supplements.org](https://www.quality-supplements.org/usp_verified_products?utm_source=openai))\n- Vitamin D3 (if you\u2019re low on a blood test): Supports bone and immune health; benefits are clearest for people who are deficient. Brand: Nature Made Vitamin D3 (USP Verified). Typical dose: personalize to your blood level; many use 1,000\u20132,000 IU/day. ([quality-supplements.org](https://www.quality-supplements.org/usp_verified_products?utm_source=openai))\n- Fiber (psyllium husk): Consistently improves lipids, glycemic control, and regularity. Brands: Metamucil (psyllium) or generic psyllium husk powder. Take with plenty of water.\n- Creatine monohydrate: Supports strength and muscle mass as we age, which correlates with better function and fall prevention. Brands: Klean Athlete Creatine (NSF Certified for Sport), Thorne Creatine. Typical dose: 3\u20135 g/day.\n\n\u201cLongevity\u2011focused\u201d additions (promising, but not proven to extend lifespan in humans)\n- Urolithin A (mitochondrial quality control/mitophagy): In randomized trials, improved muscle endurance and favorably shifted mitochondrial and inflammation biomarkers in middle\u2011aged and older adults; primary performance endpoints were mixed. Brand: Timeline Mitopure (urolithin A 500\u20131,000 mg/day). ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35584623/?utm_source=openai), [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8777576/?utm_source=openai))\n- Nicotinamide riboside (NR; NAD+ precursor): In human trials, NR raises the NAD+ metabolome in blood and muscle and shows anti\u2011inflammatory signatures; hard clinical endpoints are still unproven. Brand: Tru Niagen (uses patented Niagen NR). Typical dose: 300\u2013600 mg/day. Note: a related ingredient, NMN, is in U.S. regulatory limbo\u2014the FDA has taken the position that NMN is excluded from the dietary supplement definition pending drug\u2011development issues\u2014so I recommend NR if you want an NAD+ route.

Brand options: Nestl\u00e9 Health Science Celltrient \u201cCellular Protect\u201d (GlyNAC) or assemble with separate glycine + NAC. Typical trial dose was higher and structured; start low and review with your clinician. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35975308/?utm_source=openai), [bcm.edu](https://www.bcm.edu/news/glynac-improves-strength-and-cognition-in-older-humans?utm_source=openai))\n\nHow to choose quality locally\n- Look for the USP Verified or NSF/NSF Certified for Sport marks on the bottle; these programs test identity, potency, and contaminants. Brands like Nature Made (including D3 and many fish oils) are listed in USP\u2019s directory and are easy to find at NYC pharmacies and grocery stores. ([quality-supplements.org](https://www.quality-supplements.org/usp_verified_products?utm_source=openai))\n\nQuick safety notes\n- Always review supplements with your clinician if you\u2019re on medications (especially blood thinners for fish oil; nitrates for NAC), have kidney/liver issues, are pregnant, or have a cancer history.\n- Start one product at a time and track how you feel and any lab changes over 8\u201312 weeks.\n- Prioritize fundamentals first (sleep, resistance training 2\u20133x/week, cardio, protein 1.0\u20131.2 g/kg/day, blood pressure, A1c, and lipids). These drive most of the \u201clongevity\u201d benefit; supplements are adjuncts.\n\nWant me to tailor this to you? Tell me your age, any meds/conditions, dietary pattern (e.g., vegan), and budget, and I\u2019ll map these picks to specific NYC stores near 10001 and dial in doses.", "commit_sha": "5892cc33", "timestamp": "2025-08-28T12:01:53.205958"}

Brands: Dekristol or Vigantol (pharmacy), Sunday Natural D3+K2, Pure Encapsulations D3. Avoid K2 if you use warfarin unless your doctor approves.\n- Omega-3 (EPA/DHA, IFOS- or GOED-certified): About 1\u20132 g/day combined EPA+DHA with meals. Brands: Norsan Omega-3 Total; Minami MorEPA Platinum; Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega.

Brands: Pure Encapsulations Magnesium (bisglycinate); Sunday Natural Magnesium Bisglycinat. Alternative: Magnesium Diasporal (citrate).\n- Creatine monohydrate (muscle/strength, possible cognitive benefits): 3\u20135 g/day. Look for Creapure on the label. Brands: ESN Ultrapure Creatine (Creapure); MyProtein Creatine Monohydrate Creapure.\n\nOften sensible by situation\n- Vitamin B12 (vegans, vegetarians, or older adults): 250\u2013500 mcg/day (or 1,000 mcg a few times weekly); check B12/homocysteine. Brands: Hevert B12 (pharmacy), Sunday Natural B12, Pure Encapsulations B12.\n- Fiber (for metabolic and gut health): Psyllium 5\u201310 g/day with plenty of water.

Brands: Pharma Nord Bio-Quinone Q10; Pure Encapsulations Ubiquinol-QH; Sunday Natural Ubiquinol (Kaneka).\n- Glucosamine sulfate (joints; observational links to lower mortality): 1,500 mg/day. Brands: Dona 1500 (pharmacy); ratiopharm Glucosamin; Doppelherz Glucosamin.\n- Taurine (1\u20133 g/day) and/or glycine (3 g in the evening): supportive data for metabolic health/sleep. Brands: Sunday Natural Taurin/Glycin; MyProtein; Bulk.\n- NR (nicotinamide riboside; raises NAD+, outcomes uncertain): Up to 300 mg/day in EU-authorized products. Brands: Tru Niagen; Life Extension NAD+ Cell Regenerator. Note: NMN is not authorized for sale as a supplement in the EU.\n- Spermidine (wheat-germ extract; small human studies on cellular aging markers): 1\u20132 mg/day. Brands: spermidineLIFE; Sunday Natural Spermidin.\n- Curcumin (in enhanced-absorption forms) for low-grade inflammation: 500\u20131,000 mg/day.

Brands: Sunday Natural Berberin HCl; Fairvital. Avoid in pregnancy and if on interacting meds unless cleared by a clinician.\n\nHow to choose quality\n- Look for third-party proofs: IFOS/GOED (fish oil), Creapure (creatine), Kaneka Ubiquinol (CoQ10), K2VITAL (vitamin K2 MK-7), Niagen (NR).\n- Buy from reputable pharmacies or brand websites; check lot testing and certificates.\n\nSafety notes\n- Talk to your doctor if you take prescription meds, have kidney/liver disease, bleeding risk, are pregnant/breastfeeding, or have upcoming surgery.\n- Specific cautions: omega-3 can increase bleeding risk at higher doses; vitamin K2 conflicts with warfarin; magnesium can accumulate in advanced kidney disease; glucosamine may be from shellfish; spermidine from wheat germ contains gluten; berberine interacts with many drugs.\n- Best to baseline test: 25(OH)D, omega-3 index, B12 \u00b1 homocysteine, ferritin/iron status, and standard cardiometabolic labs; then supplement to target gaps.\n\nIf you confirm your city and any dietary pattern or meds, I can narrow this to the best local stores near you and prioritize a minimal, personalized stack.", "commit_sha": "5892cc33", "timestamp": "2025-08-28T12:04:07.811723"}
