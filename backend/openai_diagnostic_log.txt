======================================================================
CASE A: OpenAI REQUIRED Grounding
======================================================================
Model: gpt-5
Tool choice: REQUIRED
Expected: Fail-closed if no tool call, or citations if tool called

‚ö†Ô∏è Expected fail-closed: GROUNDING_NOT_SUPPORTED: Model gpt-5-chat-latest with web_search tools cannot guarantee REQUIRED mode (API limitation: tool_choice:'required' not supported). Use AUTO mode or a different model.

======================================================================
CASE B: OpenAI AUTO Grounding
======================================================================
Model: gpt-5
Tool choice: AUTO
Expected: May or may not invoke tools

‚úÖ Request completed successfully
Tool calls: 0
Grounded effective: False
Citations: 0

======================================================================
CASE C: OpenAI UNGROUNDED Baseline
======================================================================
Model: gpt-5-chat-latest
No tools attached
Expected: No tool calls, no citations

‚úÖ Request completed successfully

ANALYSIS (per ChatGPT's interpretation matrix)
======================================================================

Conclusions:
  ‚Ä¢ Case A failed-closed with GROUNDING_REQUIRED_ERROR (tool_call_count=0)
  ‚Ä¢ Case B (AUTO) had tool_call_count=0
  ‚Ä¢ Case C (ungrounded) correctly had no tools

Evidence:
  ‚Ä¢ case_a: Model did not perform search in REQUIRED mode
  ‚Ä¢ case_b: Aligns with known GPT-5 behavior: AUTO rarely searches
  ‚Ä¢ case_c: Router correctly handles ungrounded

Next Steps:
  ‚Ä¢ Very strong evidence this is a provider-side behavior/entitlement issue
