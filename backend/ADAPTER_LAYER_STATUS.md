# Adapter Layer Status - Production Ready

## Overview
All three LLM adapters (OpenAI, Gemini Direct, Vertex) have been successfully debloated and are fully functional in both grounded and ungrounded modes.

## Current Architecture

### Separation of Concerns
1. **Adapters** - Shape conversion only (request → SDK → response)
2. **Router** - Policy enforcement, capability gating, circuit breaker, pacing
3. **SDK** - Transport layer, retries, connection pooling, backoff

## Adapter Status

### OpenAI Adapter
- **Status:** ✅ Production Ready
- **Size:** 332 lines (was 734, 55% reduction)
- **Grounded:** Works with `web_search` tool
- **Ungrounded:** Works with Responses API
- **Special Features:** 
  - TextEnvelope fallback for GPT-5 empty responses
  - Reasoning hints support for GPT-5/o-series models
  - Proper citation extraction from tool calls

### Gemini Direct Adapter  
- **Status:** ✅ Production Ready
- **Size:** 434 lines (was 674, 36% reduction)
- **Grounded:** Works with GoogleSearch tool
- **Ungrounded:** Simple content generation
- **Models:** Supports all Gemini models (pro, flash)
- **Special Features:**
  - FFC (Forced Function Calling) for REQUIRED mode
  - Proper grounding evidence detection

### Vertex Adapter
- **Status:** ✅ Production Ready  
- **Size:** 403 lines (was 853, 53% reduction)
- **Grounded:** Works with GoogleSearch tool
- **Ungrounded:** Provides speculative content
- **Models:** All Gemini models via Vertex
- **Special Features:**
  - Regional deployment (europe-west4)

  - ALS context support

## Test Results Summary

### OpenAI (GPT-4o)
| Mode | Cost | Speed | Citations | Content Type |
|------|------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Grounded | ~$0.11 | ~15s | Yes (10+) | Factual with sources |
| Ungrounded | ~$0.0012 | ~1.5s | No | Limited/Declined |

### Vertex (Gemini 2.0 Flash)
| Mode | Cost | Speed | Citations | Content Type |
|------|------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Grounded | $0.000147 | 23.4s | 5 sources | Real Aug 2025 news |
| Ungrounded | $0.000212 | 24.9s | No | Speculative |

## Key Improvements

### Code Reduction
- **Total lines removed:** 1,090+ lines
- **OpenAI:** 402 lines removed (55% reduction)
- **Gemini:** 240 lines removed (36% reduction)  
- **Vertex:** 450 lines removed (53% reduction)

### Architectural Improvements
1. **No duplicate transport logic** - SDK handles all retries/backoff
2. **Clean separation** - Each layer has distinct responsibilities
3. **Router capability gating** - Prevents 400 errors from unsupported parameters
4. **Consistent error handling** - SDK errors bubble up naturally

## Grounding Capabilities

### Supported Grounding Modes
- **AUTO** - Model decides whether to search
- **REQUIRED** - Enforces web search (fails if no grounding evidence)

### Citation Extraction
- **OpenAI:** Extracts from `web_search` tool calls
- **Gemini/Vertex:** Extracts from GoogleSearch grounding metadata
- All adapters return structured citations with URLs, titles, and domains

## Router Enhancements

### Capability Matrix
```python
{
  "openai": {
    "gpt-4o": {"supports_reasoning_effort": False},
    "gpt-5": {"supports_reasoning_effort": True}
  },
  "vertex": {
    "gemini-2.5": {"supports_thinking_budget": True}
  }
}
```

### Circuit Breaker
- Per vendor:model tracking
- Configurable failure thresholds
- Automatic recovery with exponential backoff

### Pacing Control
- Respects Retry-After headers
- Prevents rate limit errors
- Per-model pacing maps

## Migration Notes

### Backup Files
Original adapters backed up as:
- `openai_adapter_bloated.py`
- `gemini_adapter_bloated.py`
- `vertex_adapter_bloated.py`

### Breaking Changes
None - all interfaces preserved

### Configuration
- Flash models now allowed through Gemini Direct
- Router handles model routing policy
- Adapters focus on API interaction only

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Ungrounded mode for all adapters
- ✅ Grounded mode with citations
- ✅ ALS context handling
- ✅ Error cases and edge conditions
- ✅ Router integration tests
- ✅ Cost and performance comparisons

### Test Files Created
- `test_openai_grounded_de.py` - OpenAI grounded with German ALS
- `test_openai_ungrounded_de.py` - OpenAI ungrounded comparison
- `test_vertex_grounded_de.py` - Vertex grounded with citations
- `test_vertex_ungrounded_de.py` - Vertex ungrounded baseline
- `test_gemini_vertex_lean.py` - Lean adapter validation
- `test_router_integration.py` - Router capability tests

## Production Readiness

### Checklist
- [x] All adapters functional in both modes
- [x] Transport logic delegated to SDK
- [x] Router capability gating working
- [x] Circuit breaker implemented
- [x] Citation extraction working
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Backup files created

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor in production** for 1-2 weeks
2. **Remove bloated backups** after stability confirmed
3. **Apply same pattern** to any future adapters
4. **Keep SDK updated** for latest transport improvements

## Conclusion

The adapter layer has been successfully streamlined following the "Bloatectomy" principle. All three adapters are production-ready with significant code reduction (45% average), improved maintainability, and full functionality preserved. The clear separation of concerns between adapters (shape), router (policy), and SDK (transport) creates a more robust and maintainable architecture.
