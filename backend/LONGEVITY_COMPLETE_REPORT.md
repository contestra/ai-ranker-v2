While this tailored approach is innovative, customer reviews are mixed, with some users reporting dissatisfaction with customer service and the perceived value of the service. As this is a newer frontier in supplementation, consumers may want to approach with a degree of caution and conduct thorough personal research.

Ultimately, the most effective longevity strategy combines targeted supplementation from trusted brands with a healthy lifestyle that includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, and adequate sleep.
