Short answer: there's no pill proven to extend human lifespan. But a few supplements have decent human evidence for supporting "healthspan" markers (cardiometabolic health, muscle and bone, cognition) and are easy to buy at major US retailers. Below are evidence-based picks, typical studied doses, and respected brands widely available.

Key Recommendations:

1. **Omega-3 Fatty Acids (EPA/DHA)**
   - Evidence: Cardiovascular health, inflammation, cognitive function
   - Dose: 1-2g EPA+DHA daily
   - Brands: Nordic Naturals, Life Extension Super Omega-3, Carlson Labs
   - Where: CVS, Walgreens, Whole Foods, Amazon

2. **Vitamin D3**
   - Evidence: Bone health, immune function, mood
   - Dose: 1000-4000 IU daily (test blood levels)
   - Brands: Thorne, NOW Foods, Nature Made
   - Where: Any pharmacy, grocery store

3. **Magnesium**
   - Evidence: Heart rhythm, blood pressure, sleep, muscle function
   - Dose: 200-400mg daily (glycinate or citrate forms)
   - Brands: Life Extension, Doctor's Best, Pure Encapsulations
   - Where: GNC, Vitamin Shoppe, online

4. **Probiotic**
   - Evidence: Gut health, immune support
   - Dose: 10-50 billion CFU daily
   - Brands: Garden of Life, Culturelle, Align
   - Where: Target, CVS, Whole Foods

5. **NAD+ Precursors (if budget allows)**
   - Evidence: Cellular energy, DNA repair (mostly animal studies)
   - Options: NMN or NR
   - Brands: Tru Niagen (NR), Life Extension NAD+ Cell Regenerator
   - Where: Online primarily, some Vitamin Shoppe locations

Optional Based on Individual Needs:
- **Creatine** (3-5g daily): Muscle, brain function - Optimum Nutrition, Thorne
- **Curcumin** (500-1000mg with piperine): Anti-inflammatory - Life Extension, Jarrow
- **CoQ10** (100-200mg): Heart health, statin users - Qunol, Doctor's Best

Shopping Tips:
- Look for third-party testing (NSF, USP, ConsumerLab)
- Check expiration dates
- Compare prices between local stores and online
- Consider subscribe-and-save options for regular use

Most important: Focus on lifestyle factors first (exercise, sleep, Mediterranean-style diet, stress management). Supplements are supplementary—they work best alongside healthy habits, not as replacements.

Happy to help. To recommend brands "available in your area," I'll need your location (city/country or ZIP/postcode). If you share any medications, health conditions, diet (e.g., vegan), and main goals (brain health? muscle? cardiovascular?), I can tailor suggestions better.

Short answer up front: a "best" longevity stack is mostly about addressing big, proven risks (cardiovascular, metabolic, muscle and bone health) with well-made, third-party–tested basics. Below are options you'll find at major US chains (CVS, Walgreens, GNC, Whole Foods) plus online.

**Core Evidence-Based Stack:**

1. **Omega-3 (EPA+DHA)** - Heart, brain, inflammation
   - Dose: 1-2g EPA+DHA daily
   - Brands: Nordic Naturals, Life Extension, Carlson
   - Find at: Any pharmacy, Costco (Kirkland brand is solid)

2. **Vitamin D3** - Bone, immune, mood
   - Dose: 1000-4000 IU (test blood levels ideally)
   - Brands: Thorne, NOW, Nature Made
   - Find at: Literally everywhere

3. **Magnesium** - Sleep, BP, muscle function
   - Dose: 200-400mg (glycinate or citrate form)
   - Brands: Doctor's Best, Life Extension, Pure Encapsulations
   - Find at: GNC, Vitamin Shoppe, Amazon

4. **Basic Multivitamin** - Nutritional insurance
   - Brands: Thorne Basic Nutrients, Life Extension Two-Per-Day
   - Find at: Health stores, online

**If Budget Allows:**

5. **CoQ10/Ubiquinol** - Cellular energy, heart (essential if on statins)
   - Dose: 100-200mg
   - Brands: Qunol, Jarrow, Doctor's Best
   - Find at: CVS, Walgreens

6. **Probiotic** - Gut/immune health
   - Dose: 10-50 billion CFU
   - Brands: Garden of Life, Culturelle, Align
   - Find at: Target, grocery stores

7. **NAD+ Precursor** - Cellular repair (mostly animal data)
   - Options: Tru Niagen (NR), Life Extension NAD+ Cell Regenerator
   - Find at: Mainly online, some GNC/Vitamin Shoppe

**Shopping Tips:**
- Costco/Sam's Club often best value for basics
- Subscribe & Save on Amazon saves 15-20%
- Look for NSF or USP certified products
- Check ConsumerLab.com for independent testing

**Reality Check:**
The unsexy truth is that resistance training (2-3x/week), 150+ minutes moderate cardio, Mediterranean-ish diet, 7-9 hours sleep, and maintaining social connections dwarf any supplement benefit. Supplements are the cherry on top, not the sundae.

Start with omega-3, D3, and magnesium—those have the strongest evidence and broadest benefits. Add others based on specific needs (CoQ10 if on statins, probiotics if gut issues, etc.).

Of course. However, before I provide recommendations, it's essential to cover a few critical points:

**1. The Most Important Disclaimer:** I am an AI assistant, not a medical doctor. The information provided is for educational purposes only. Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if you have existing health conditions or take medications.

**2. "Longevity" is Complex:** While certain supplements show promise in research for supporting healthspan (the years lived in good health), no supplement has been proven to definitively extend human lifespan.

## **Evidence-Based Longevity Supplement Stack**

### **Tier 1: Strong Evidence Base**

**1. Omega-3 Fatty Acids (EPA/DHA)**
- **Purpose:** Cardiovascular health, brain function, inflammation control
- **Dose:** 1-3g combined EPA/DHA daily
- **Brands:** Nordic Naturals, Life Extension, Thorne, NOW Foods
- **Where to buy:** CVS, Walgreens, Whole Foods, GNC, Vitamin Shoppe

**2. Vitamin D3**

## Summary Statistics

### Geographic Accuracy by Vendor
**OpenAI (gpt-5):**
- US targeting: 60% accurate (3/5 US tests correctly focused)
- DE targeting: 0% accurate (0/3 DE tests correctly focused)
- Issue: DE requests return mixed or US-only brands

**Vertex (gemini-2.5-pro):**
- US targeting: 100% accurate (5/5 US tests correctly focused)
- DE targeting: 100% accurate (3/3 DE tests correctly focused)
- Excellent geographic differentiation

### Policy Effectiveness
- **ALS_ONLY**: Most effective for geographic targeting
- **PROXY_ONLY**: Limited effectiveness, especially for OpenAI
- **ALS_PLUS_PROXY**: Works well for Vertex, mixed for OpenAI
- **Grounding**: Successfully activated for both vendors

### Performance Metrics
- **Fastest Response**: Vertex DE ALS_ONLY (32.4s)
- **Slowest Response**: OpenAI DE PROXY_ONLY (119.8s)
- **Average OpenAI**: 71.3s
- **Average Vertex**: 50.2s

## Conclusions

1. **Vertex demonstrates superior geographic differentiation** with 100% accuracy
2. **OpenAI shows partial geographic awareness** but needs improvement for non-US locations
3. **All policy modes are functional** but vary in effectiveness
4. **Grounding mode works correctly** for both vendors
5. **Rate limiting successfully managed** with 20-second delays

## Recommendations

1. Use Vertex for geographic-specific queries requiring high accuracy
2. Implement stronger location signals for OpenAI DE requests
3. Review proxy configuration for better geographic routing
4. Maintain 20-second delays between OpenAI requests in production
5. Consider prompt engineering improvements for OpenAI geographic targeting
