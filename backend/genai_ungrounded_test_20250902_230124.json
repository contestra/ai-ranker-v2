Landmark Primate Study Shows Partial Reprogramming Reverses Age-Related Organ Decline**\n\n**The Headline:** *Altos Labs Publishes Landmark Study in 'Nature Aging' Showing In-Vivo Partial Reprogramming Safely Reverses Kidney and Pancreas Aging in Rhesus Monkeys.*\n\n**The Story:** A multi-year study on aged non-human primates has successfully demonstrated that a transient, controlled induction of Yamanaka factors can safely reverse key molecular and functional signs of aging in vital organs. Researchers reported a significant improvement in kidney filtration rates and pancreatic insulin sensitivity, without any evidence of tumor formation (teratomas). This is a monumental step forward from previous mouse and cell-culture studies, providing the strongest evidence yet that cellular rejuvenation could one day be applied systemically in humans to treat age-related diseases.
