In the U.S. (including New York), there is **no Value Added Tax (VAT)**. Instead, states and localities impose **sales tax**.  

For your context:  
- **New York State sales tax** is **4%**.  
- **New York City adds 4.5%** local sales tax.  
- There‚Äôs also a **0.375% Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District (MCTD) surcharge** in NYC.  

That makes the **total NYC sales tax rate 8.875%**.  

So if you‚Äôre seeing a tax on a DMV-related transaction or local purchase, it‚Äôs **sales tax, not VAT**.  

üëâ Would you like me to break down whether DMV service fees (like a REAL ID appointment fee) are actually subject to sales tax, or just flat state fees?

The United States (including New York) does **not use Value Added Tax (VAT)**. Instead, New York applies a **state sales and use tax**.  

- **State sales tax rate (New York):** **4%**  
- **Local sales tax (NYC):** an additional **4.5%**, plus a **Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District (MCTD) surcharge of 0.375%**.  
- **Total in New York City:** **8.875%**  

So, while there is **no VAT in New York**, the equivalent tax you encounter at the DMV or for general purchases in NYC is **8.875% sales tax**.  

Would you like me to explain how this would apply specifically to DMV fees like the $12.90 charge you listed?

In Germany, the **standard VAT (Mehrwertsteuer, MwSt.) rate is 19%**.  

There is also a **reduced rate of 7%**, but that applies only to specific goods and services (e.g. certain foodstuffs, books, cultural items).  

For fees related to public authority services (like a passport application or administrative charges), these are usually **not subject to VAT at all**, because they are classified as public-law fees rather than commercial services.  

üëâ In your example ("Reisepass beantragen Termin" / passport application fee of 12,90 ‚Ç¨), this is an **administrative fee** and therefore **no VAT is added**. The amount is the final fee.  

Would you like me to show you the general rule that distinguishes between **VAT-liable services** and **public authority fees**, so you can clearly see why the passport fee has no MwSt.?

### No VAT in the U.S.; New York City Sales Tax is 8.875%

The United States does not have a national Value Added Tax (VAT). Instead, a decentralized sales tax system is in place, with rates varying by state, county, and city.

For New York City, the total sales and use tax rate is 8.875%. This combined rate is composed of three parts:

*   **4.5%** New York City local sales and use tax

However, some items are exempt from sales tax, such as groceries, diapers, and clothing and footwear purchases under $110. For clothing and footwear purchases over $110, the full 8.875% tax rate applies.

In Germany, the standard value-added tax (VAT) rate is 19%. For certain goods and services, a reduced rate of 7% applies.

The standard VAT rate of 19% is the default rate for most goods and services. The reduced rate of 7% is applicable to a specific list of items considered basic necessities, which includes products like food, books, and public transport. For "general information" services, the standard tax rate of 19% is applied.

There were temporary changes to the VAT rates in the past, for instance, a reduction from July 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020, to mitigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, these changes are no longer in effect. As of early 2024, the VAT rates have returned to the standard 19% and the reduced 7%.
