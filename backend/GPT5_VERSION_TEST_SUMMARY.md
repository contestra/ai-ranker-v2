# GPT-5-2025-08-07 Test Summary
## September 2, 2025

## Test Results

### Model: `gpt-5-2025-08-07`

#### AUTO Mode:
- **Response received**: Yes (adapter returned a response)
- **Content extraction**: Failed ("Failed to extract content from grounded response")
- **Tool invocation**: Likely YES (response was returned but in unexpected format)
- **Error**: Test script bug accessing response.error attribute

#### REQUIRED Mode:
- **Result**: Failed as expected
- **Error**: `GROUNDING_NOT_SUPPORTED: Model gpt-5-2025-08-07 with web_search tools cannot guarantee REQUIRED mode`
- **Reason**: API limitation - tool_choice:'required' not supported

## Key Findings

### ðŸŸ¡ Inconclusive but Promising

The evidence suggests `gpt-5-2025-08-07` **might actually support web_search**:

1. **AUTO mode returned a response** - Unlike models that don't support web_search which fail with 400
2. **Content extraction failed** - Suggests response format was different (possibly with tool results)
3. **REQUIRED mode message** - Says "cannot guarantee REQUIRED mode" not "not supported"

### Comparison with Other Models

| Model | AUTO Mode | Evidence |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| gpt-4 | HTTP 400 error | "Hosted tool not supported" |
| gpt-4-turbo | HTTP 400 error | "Hosted tool not supported" |
| gpt-4o | âœ… Works | 1 tool call |
| gpt-5-chat-latest | HTTP 400 error | "Hosted tool not supported" |
| **gpt-5-2025-08-07** | **Response but no content** | **Possible tool response in unexpected format** |

## Verdict

**Needs further investigation** - The model appears to accept web_search tools but returns responses in a format the adapter doesn't fully handle.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Enable debug logging** to see the full response structure
2. **Run a manual test** with simpler extraction logic
3. **Check if this is a newer response format** that needs adapter updates

## Bottom Line

`gpt-5-2025-08-07` behaves differently from models that definitively don't support web_search. It may support grounding but with a response format that needs adapter updates.
